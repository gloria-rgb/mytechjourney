             <h1>My Tech Journey</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Okoye, Gloria Chinwendu. I am a native of Anambra state. My journey into tech is not the most conventional one, but it’s a story I hold close to my heart because it has shaped me into the resilient woman I am today.
    </p>
    <p>
      I first got to know about technology through my ex. He was a software engineer—brilliant, passionate, and always immersed in code. He used to talk about his work with so much enthusiasm that it rubbed off on me. He was the first person who encouraged me to try out programming. Just out of curiosity, I started learning on my own. I still remember the very first time I stumbled upon <span class="highlight">W3Schools</span>. That was my starting point. I would spend hours reading tutorials, building little HTML pages, and feeling so proud of every tiny progress I made.
    </p>
    <p>
      But life happened. When we eventually broke up, the vibe and the excitement I once felt for tech died down completely. I didn’t want to do anything that reminded me of him, and that included coding. So I stopped. For months, I couldn’t bring myself to open my laptop or look at anything code-related.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn’t until my 300 level in university that I slowly found my way back. By then, I realized that the curiosity I once had for tech wasn’t really about him—it was mine all along. Resuming again wasn’t easy, though. Balancing school with learning to code felt almost impossible. There were days I stayed up all night, battling JavaScript errors and tutorials that felt like they were written in a foreign language. My roommates thought I was doing too much, and they would often laugh when they woke up to see me still glued to my laptop. But in my heart, I knew I didn’t want to give up.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was slow. Very slow. But I kept pushing. I joined almost every online bootcamp I could find—<span class="highlight">Side Hustle (now Terra)</span>, <span class="highlight">DevTech</span>, <span class="highlight">Genesys Learnable</span>. I even remember the Genesys Learnable program got so hectic at some point that I had to drop out because it was just too much to juggle with school. Sometimes, no matter how hard I tried, I just wasn’t grasping the concepts as quickly as I wanted to. But I showed up. Every. Single. Time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ironically, what kept me motivated were tech events. Whenever I attended a meetup or workshop, I would see people like me—young, hopeful, struggling, but still showing up. It reminded me that I wasn’t alone. And let’s not forget the countless times I had to deal with faulty laptops. It felt like the universe was testing my resolve—every time I was making progress, my laptop would develop one mysterious problem or the other. Looking back now, it’s funny, but back then, it was really frustrating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fast forward to 2023—I got married. It was a new, beautiful chapter of my life, and I thought maybe things would finally be smooth. I enrolled in a physical coding class, and for the first time in a while, everything felt like it was falling into place. But then I got pregnant and eventually put to bed. As you might guess, everything went on pause again. I was exhausted, overwhelmed, and to be honest, depressed. I felt like all the progress I had made evaporated overnight. I could barely remember anything I had learned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Months passed in that fog, until one day, my best friend, <span class="highlight">Wini</span>, called. She didn’t just stop at checking in—she came over to the house and sat with me. She reminded me of the fire I once had, the dreams I wasn’t ready to abandon. Wini, bless her heart, reignited something in me. Slowly, I started again, relearning, rebuilding, and forgiving myself for the time I had lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      And my husband—he has been my biggest supporter. He saw how much it meant to me and surprised me with a new laptop to help me get back on track. You’ll probably say “awwn” at this point—and you should, because it was such a thoughtful gesture that meant more to me than words can express.
    </p>
    <p>
      One kid later, countless setbacks, and I’m still here in tech—finding my way, sometimes stumbling, but always getting back up. It has not been an easy road. But if there’s anything my journey has taught me, it’s that it doesn’t matter how many times you pause or how long it takes you to get there. What matters is that you don’t give up.
    </p>
    <p>
      So here I am, still learning, still building, and still holding on to my passion for technology. I am not giving up anytime soon. This is just the beginning.
